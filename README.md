# Game rules and information.



 __Starting Page__

 * Once the page loads you are greeted with the below screen<br/>
 I have tried to make this fairly simple , You "The Humble User" Are greeted with the welcoming message and a large TIC-TAC-TOE Inscription , In order to start the game you will have to authorize the input , More on that below...

 ![Welcome screen](/images/start.JPG)

 * If you are brave enough to challenge the mighty AI you will type yes or yea to initiate the game, However if you refuse the challenge and instead type no, The game will close. 

 * Rules are farily simple You are in control of " X " , Battling the fiesty AI in control of " O " , Remember afterall this is just a basic TIC TAC TOE!, Two players (You and AI) take turns putting marks on a 3x3 board. The goal of Tic Tac Toe game is to be the first to get three same symbols in a row - horizontally, vertically or diagonally on a 3 x 3 grid. The player who first gets 3 of his/her symbols (marks) in a row - vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins the game, and the other loses the game.

__WINNER LOOSER OR A TIE?__

* When designing the game, It was important to be able to determine who wins Loses or if there is a tie at the end, Each outcome will display a different message and each outcome is fully thought of in the code itself.




__END GAME/RESULT PAGE__

*  Depending on the result at the end game , A different page will be generated if you won/lost or tied the game , Play and find out! , See examples below.

## __Testing__


* I can confirm the code used on this project has been tested with :<br/> https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/  Which hasn't returned any pressing errors.

* However i feel like it is important to note that i have failed to generate a restart the game option, At the point of game completion.
I wanted to do this without the need to manually run the program on Heroku page, But rather through the console , Which would opt the player to run the game once - more in case of a lose or a tie. 
  
  
* At the time of writing there are no bugs known to me. <br/>
However having said that it is not impossible that one might be out there and i just simply havent found it yet :)

__If you do however encounter an error or a bug while playing the game , Please do contact me.__
